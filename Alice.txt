Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.
And now I live in Mike's git repository and he made some changes.
Now he's adding the third line to me :)
Now he's making a fourth change to me.
Hey we're adding a change simulating something like someone else is also working on our project.
Creating some more conflicts, kindd like someone is working in parallel with us.
